There are a lot of Backman fans in the world and many in our group, and, so far, word on the street is that this, his latest publication, doesn't disappoint. It sounds like an excellent summer/beach read novel. Enjoy!\\n\\nFrom Goodreads:\\n\\nA poignant, charming novel about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined\\n\\nLooking at real estate isn't usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can't fix up their own marriage. There's a wealthy banker who has been too busy making money to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can't seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment's only bathroom, and you've got the worst group of hostages in the world.\\n\\nEach of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in a motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.\\n\\nHumorous, compassionate, and wise, \\\"Anxious People\\\" is an ingeniously constructed story about the enduring power of friendship, forgiveness, and hope—the things that save us, even in the most anxious of times.\",\"startDate\":\"2021-07-25T18:00:00.000Z\",\"endDate\":\"2021-07-25T20:00:00.000Z\",\"eventStatus\":\"https://schema.org/EventScheduled\",\"eventAttendanceMode\":\"https://schema.org/OnlineEventAttendanceMode\",\"image\":\"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/\",\"location\":{\"@type\":\"VirtualLocation\",\"url\":\"https://www.meetup.com/NYC-20-something-book-club/events/275965834\"},\"organizer\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"20/30 something book club\",\"url\":\"https://www.meetup.com/NYC-20-something-book-club\"},\"performer\":\"20/30 something book club\"},{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Event\",\"name\":\"Let's make short films!\",\"url\":\"https://www.meetup.com/Film-Production-Meetup/events/278874871\",\"description\":\"The purpose of this meetup is to network and meet other people that are passionate about film.

The mindset arises from a core belief in lack. Here are some symptoms of a scarcity mindset:\\n\\n1. Low expectations: One does not expect more from life and becomes resigned to an existence confined by fear and lack.\\n2. Lack of investment: One sees resources as limited and chooses to hoard them rather than invest them in growth opportunities.\\n3. Lack of sharing: One sees life as a zero-sum game leading to competition and the need to win over others. The thought of sharing resources with others does not even arise.\\n\\nIt is easy to see that a scarcity mindset creates misery both at individual and collective levels.\\n\\nThe abundance mindset believes that the universe will provide whatever is needed to make the most of your incarnation. It allows us to go beyond worrying about how we will be taken care of and instead, focus on joy, growth, and sharing.\\n\\nJoin us for this free webinar to learn how to move from the mindset of scarcity to abundance. A Q&A session will follow this workshop.\\n\\nAbout the speaker: Dr. K Narayan has a Ph.D. in Quantum Mechanics. His passion is to integrate ideas from both Science and Spirituality to transform our lives.\\n\\nSupport us through tax-deductible donations:\\nhttps://childrenofinfinity.org/donationpage/\\n\\nSubscribe to our Youtube channel\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ChildrenofInfinity\",\"startDate\":\"2021-08-08T17:00:00.000Z\",\"endDate\":\"2021-08-08T18:00:00.000Z\",\"eventStatus\":\"https://schema.org/EventScheduled\",\"eventAttendanceMode\":\"https://schema.org/OnlineEventAttendanceMode\",\"image\":\"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/\",\"location\":{\"@type\":\"VirtualLocation\",\"url\":\"https://www.meetup.com/embodiedspirituality/events/278827807\"},\"organizer\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Practical Spirituality\",\"url\":\"https://www.meetup.com/embodiedspirituality\"},\"performer\":\"Practical Spirituality\"},{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Event\",\"name\":\"Central Park Picnic \",\"url\":\"https://www.meetup.com/big-apple-beauties-30s-50s/events/279422642\",\"description\":\"Central Park Picnic: Bring your own snacks/lunch and a drink if you’d like.

There are a lot of Backman fans in the world and many in our group, and, so far, word on the street is that this, his latest publication, doesn't disappoint. It sounds like an excellent summer/beach read novel. Enjoy!\\n\\nFrom Goodreads:\\n\\nA poignant, charming novel about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined\\n\\nLooking at real estate isn't usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can't fix up their own marriage. There's a wealthy banker who has been too busy making money to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can't seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment's only bathroom, and you've got the worst group of hostages in the world.\\n\\nEach of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue.

The mindset arises from a core belief in lack. Here are some symptoms of a scarcity mindset:\\n\\n1. Low expectations: One does not expect more from life and becomes resigned to an existence confined by fear and lack.\\n2. Lack of investment: One sees resources as limited and chooses to hoard them rather than invest them in growth opportunities.\\n3. Lack of sharing: One sees life as a zero-sum game leading to competition and the need to win over others. The thought of sharing resources with others does not even arise.\\n\\nIt is easy to see that a scarcity mindset creates misery both at individual and collective levels.\\n\\nThe abundance mindset believes that the universe will provide whatever is needed to make the most of your incarnation. It allows us to go beyond worrying about how we will be taken care of and instead, focus on joy, growth, and sharing.\\n\\nJoin us for this free webinar to learn how to move from the mindset of scarcity to abundance.

Once sketched, you will then PAINT HIM on your canvas.\\n\\nTickets (if purchased by June 27 -- early 'gurl' ticket) is $57.96 (tax \\u0026 fee incl.) June 28 and after, tickets are $63.58 (tax \\u0026 fee incl.)\\n\\nFollowing is the link to their website to purchase your ticket: www.letspainthim.com/nynj20\\n\\nYour ticket will include the following:\\n\\n1. Entry\\n2. Paint canvas\\n3. Paint\\n4. Brushes\\n5.

Valid ID is required upon check in and tickets must be purchased in advance. No tickets will be sold at the door, as the location will only be disclosed upon ticket purchase. The location and final details will be emailed to you with your confirmation a few days before the event.\\n\\nIn addition, masks must be worn during direct contact for the LPH Sip \\u0026 Stroke 🍆 session.\\n\\nTo maintain a mature and intimate atmosphere only (50) tickets will be sold for this event. I attended last March and trust, they go very quickly! That said, it would behoove us to purchase our tickets sooner, rather than later!\\n\\nUnderstand, I WILL NOT purchase a ticket until at least one other person has purchased theirs for obvious reasons. I mean after all, who wants to chill alone?! 🤷🏾‍♀️\\n\\nSo please let me know once you have purchased your ticket. I promise you will not be disappointed.
